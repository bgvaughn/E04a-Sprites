# E04a-Sprites Exercise

In this repository I added some changed spawn points for a set amount of time. In this case it was 20, so 20 ramdom animals poped up in different location on the screen. (That was for main1 py.) Then I changed the the location of the animal and added a single animal beside so they would use the same speech bubble. (That was for main2 py.) Then I changed the self location so that it would move to the motion of my mouse anywhere on the screen. (That was for main3 py.) I lastly I had no freaking idea what to do with the last one so I skipped it. (That was for main4 py.)
